This is a list of my most recent projects.

1. Adding two numbers using `R`.
```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
print(a + b)
```

2. Sampling from the Standard Normal Distribution.
```{r}
(v <- rnorm(n = 10))
```

3. Multiplying two vectors.
```{r}
x <- seq(from = 1, to = 3, by = 1)
y <- seq(from = 4, to = 6, by = 1)
(z <- x %*% y)
```
